+ Nice concise description and future scenario

+ Nice name for your app Joy.

- Sharing happiness is not your user need - the user need is improve their quality of life and be more positive, stay close with their family and friends. Sharing happiness is the method that your group chose to help people address these needs. They don't even know that they have this need¡­ perhaps they have a need to share misery what will happen then? I wonder how your app will address this? Will you need some moderation or can social pressure be used for this same effect?

- There will always be different opinions about which apps are good and which are not. You only need to find "enough" people to like your app to be relevant and valuable to "some" people. You can decide what kind of people and how many implies you have succeeded.

- Being similar to other apps is not necessarily a problem. Many successful products addressed an old problem in a new way and succeeded, instagram is one example it followed, Flicker, Pinterest, FB, etc and yet found its own niche, so I wouldn't worry just do a great job with your target problem space and your target audience. But also do not exclude their current reality - if most of your users use FB or Instagram already, your app could have an automatic pluggin for those other systems to make it more relevant and viral.

+ Yes, the Back button is very valuable and expected.

+ Good analysis of the test results and updates to your interface.

+- I like your LEAF logo, but perhaps expecting people to discover its use was asking too much of your novice users. 

+ I appreciate you making the effort to make your presentation document beautiful

- The background image you chose for your presentation made some of the text hard to read


+ I really appreciate the thought you put into your prototype to create so many details
