- Good job with the prototype design and details, and very thorough content

- Good job on the test script

- Consider adding after each task: I would like to ask you about the ease of completing that task.

"How would you rate this task on a scale of "VERY DIFFICULT 1..2..3..4..5 VERY EASY" 

- Consider adding after each task: Can you tell me about the speed of completing that task?

"How would you rate this task on a scale of "VERY SLOW 1..2..3..4..5 VERY FAST" 

- At the end of the test in the wrap up  discussion consider updating the questions as such:

        How smooth do you think the process is? 

        What bothers you the most in the whole process?

Instead try asking: Was there any part of the process that you found problematic? бн  Can you tell me a bit more about this?

           How long would you stay for this if you can choose? 

Instead say: How valuable would you say this app is for you? Using the following scale

NOT AT ALL VALUABLE 1  2  3  4  5 VERY VALUABLE

Also say: If you had this experience with this app, like you had now, would you use it?


Yes / No; and Why? _____________
